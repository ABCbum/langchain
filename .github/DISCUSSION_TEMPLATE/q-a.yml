        Thanks for your interest in LangChain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó!

        Please follow these instructions, fill every question, and do every step. üôè
        
        We're asking for this because answering questions and solving problems in GitHub takes a lot of time --
        this is time that we cannot spend on adding new features, fixing bugs, writing documentation or reviewing pull requests.

        By asking questions in a structured way (following this) it will be much easier for us to help you.

        There's a high chance that by following this process, you'll find the solution on your own, eliminating the need to submit a question and wait for an answer. üòé

        As there are many questions submitted every day, we will **DISCARD** and close the incomplete ones. 
        
        That will allow us (and others) to focus on helping people like you that follow the whole process. ü§ì
        
        Relevant links to check before opening a question to see if your question has already been answered, fixed or
        if there's another way to solve your problem:
