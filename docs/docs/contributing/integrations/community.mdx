# Contribute Community Integrations

:::info
Before beginning, make sure you have read about the different types of integrations in the [Contributing Integrations](./index.mdx) guide.
:::

In the following sections, we'll walk through how to contribute to each of these packages from a fake company, `Parrot Link AI`.

## What is a community integration

Community integrations 

## Why contribute a community integration

## How to contribute a community integration



To begin, make sure you have all the dependencies outlined in guide on [Contributing Code](/docs/contributing/code/).

The `langchain-community` package is in `libs/community` and contains most integrations.

It can be installed with `pip install langchain-community`, and exported members can be imported with code like 

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatParrotLink
from langchain_community.llms import ParrotLinkLLM
from langchain_community.vectorstores import ParrotLinkVectorStore
```

The `community` package relies on manually-installed dependent packages, so you will see errors 
if you try to import a package that is not installed. In our fake example, if you tried to import `ParrotLinkLLM` without installing `parrot-link-sdk`, you will see an `ImportError` telling you to install it when trying to use it.

Let's say we wanted to implement a chat model for Parrot Link AI. We would create a new file in `libs/community/langchain_community/chat_models/parrot_link.py` with the following code:

```python
from langchain_core.language_models.chat_models import BaseChatModel

class ChatParrotLink(BaseChatModel):
    """ChatParrotLink chat model.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatParrotLink

            model = ChatParrotLink()
    """

    ...
```

And we would write tests in:

- Unit tests: `libs/community/tests/unit_tests/chat_models/test_parrot_link.py`
- Integration tests: `libs/community/tests/integration_tests/chat_models/test_parrot_link.py`

And add documentation to:

- `docs/docs/integrations/chat/parrot_link.ipynb`
