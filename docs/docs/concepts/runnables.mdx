# Runnable Interface
<span data-heading-keywords="invoke,runnable"></span>

To make it as easy as possible to create custom chains, we've implemented a ["Runnable"](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.Runnable.html#langchain_core.runnables.base.Runnable) protocol. Many LangChain components implement the `Runnable` protocol, including chat models, LLMs, output parsers, retrievers, prompt templates, and more. There are also several useful primitives for working with runnables, which you can read about below.

This is a standard interface, which makes it easy to define custom chains as well as invoke them in a standard way.
The standard interface includes:

- `stream`: stream back chunks of the response
- `invoke`: call the chain on an input
- `batch`: call the chain on a list of inputs

These also have corresponding async methods that should be used with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) `await` syntax for concurrency:

- `astream`: stream back chunks of the response async
- `ainvoke`: call the chain on an input async
- `abatch`: call the chain on a list of inputs async
- `astream_log`: stream back intermediate steps as they happen, in addition to the final response
- `astream_events`: **beta** stream events as they happen in the chain (introduced in `langchain-core` 0.1.14)

The **input type** and **output type** varies by component:

| Component    | Input Type                                            | Output Type           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Prompt       | Dictionary                                            | PromptValue           |
| ChatModel    | Single string, list of chat messages or a PromptValue | ChatMessage           |
| LLM          | Single string, list of chat messages or a PromptValue | String                |
| OutputParser | The output of an LLM or ChatModel                     | Depends on the parser |
| Retriever    | Single string                                         | List of Documents     |
| Tool         | Single string or dictionary, depending on the tool    | Depends on the tool   |


All runnables expose input and output **schemas** to inspect the inputs and outputs:
- `input_schema`: an input Pydantic model auto-generated from the structure of the Runnable
- `output_schema`: an output Pydantic model auto-generated from the structure of the Runnable
